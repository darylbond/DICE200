# DICE300

This the DICE300 3D printer. It is an original design heavily inspired by the original DICE by [Rene Jurack](http://well-engineered.net). The printer is approximately a cube of 300mm outside dimension with approximately 200mm cube build area. All parts are designed to be made with a CNC router and/or lathe.

## Version 1

The files currently available are the AS BUILT files. This means that it is a direct representation of the 3D printer that I have built. It includes all of the mistakes and work-arounds that this entails. If you are looking through the models and find things that don't make a lot of sense, chances are that it is a fix that I had to introduce after finding a problem with my design and then modifying the design without changing already made parts. An example of this are the two spacers on the coolant splitter block which were introduced after changing some plate thicknesses from 4mm to 3mm after I had already made the splitter block.

* XB

### Possible upgrades

There are number of things that I would like to change if I was to make another of these printers:

* Use 10mm spacer under the y-axis rails rather than 8mm. This allows the use of readily available stock material without having to machine to thickness.
* Maybe have a belt driven z-screw to remove necessity for the spacer under the y-axis rails. Or use a thinner drive motor, although this gives less torque.
* Use 6mm frame spacers. The current sizing was done based on using counter-sunk screws everywhere.
* Leave more space between the print head assembly and the x-carriage to allow easier cable management.
* Only need single screws on the floor plate instead of the two per location as currently used.
* Allow for the radiator to be detached without needing to undo the hoses.
* Allow the hot-end assembly to be removed without the heatsink. This would allow easier maintenance of the filament path, nozzle, etc.
* more when I think of them...
